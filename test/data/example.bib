                   connectivity mapping with MRI and show how such data
                   can be used to infer new information of both brain

                   challenges that should be addressed in the future to
                   achieve high-resolution maps of structural
                   connectivity. From the resulting tremendous amount of
                   data that is going to be accumulated soon, we discuss
                   what new challenges must be tackled in terms of

                   visualization, as well data organization and

                   investigate key questions on brain complexity and we

                   brings in vivo brain imaging closer to the real

                   this review we analyze the current situation from the
                   technical and biological perspectives. First, we
                   critically review the technical solutions proposed in
                   the literature to perform clinical studies. We
                   analyze for each step (i.e. MRI acquisition, network
                   building and network statistical analysis) the
                   advantages and potential limitations. In the second
                   part we review the current literature available on a
                   selected subset of diseases, namely, dementia,
                   schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis and others, and try

                   investigated the genetic basis of human brain network
                   structure and function through three complementary
                   frameworks: (1) the quantification of phenotypic
                   heritability through classical twin designs; (2) the
                   identification of specific DNA variants linked to
                   phenotypic variation through association and related
                   studies; and (3) the analysis of correlations between
                   spatial variations in imaging phenotypes and gene
                   expression profiles through the integration of
                   neuroimaging and transcriptional atlas data. We

                   that genetic influences are not uniformly distributed

                   repeated-measurement resting-state functional MRI to
                   explore intersubject variability in connectivity.
                   Individual differences in functional connectivity
                   were heterogeneous across the cortex, with
                   significantly higher variability in heteromodal
                   association cortex and lower variability in unimodal
                   cortices. Intersubject variability in connectivity
                   was significantly correlated with the degree of
                   evolutionary cortical expansion, suggesting a
                   potential evolutionary root of functional
                   variability. The connectivity variability was also
                   related to variability in sulcal depth but not
                   cortical thickness, positively correlated with the
                   degree of long-range connectivity but negatively
                   correlated with local connectivity. A meta-analysis
                   further revealed that regions predicting individual
                   differences in cognitive domains are predominantly
                   located in regions of high connectivity variability.

                   typically collapse data from many subjects, but brain
                   functional organization varies between individuals.
                   Here we establish that this individual variability is
                   both robust and reliable, using data from the Human
                   Connectome Project to demonstrate that functional
                   connectivity profiles act as a 'fingerprint' that can
                   accurately identify subjects from a large group.
                   Identification was successful across scan sessions
                   and even between task and rest conditions, indicating
                   that an individual's connectivity profile is
                   intrinsic, and can be used to distinguish that
                   individual regardless of how the brain is engaged
                   during imaging. Characteristic connectivity patterns
                   were distributed throughout the brain, but the
                   frontoparietal network emerged as most distinctive.
                   Furthermore, we show that connectivity profiles
                   predict levels of fluid intelligence: the same
                   networks that were most discriminating of individuals
                   were also most predictive of cognitive behavior.

                   varies between individuals, and characterizing this
                   variability is crucial for relating brain activity to
                   behavioral phenotypes. Rest has become the default
                   state for probing individual differences, chiefly
                   because it is easy to acquire and a supposed neutral
                   backdrop. However, the assumption that rest is the
                   optimal condition for individual differences research
                   is largely untested. In fact, other brain states may
                   afford a better ratio of within- to between-subject
                   variability, facilitating biomarker discovery.
                   Depending on the trait or behavior under study,

                   measured by capturing correlated brain activity with
                   fMRI. There is considerable interest in understanding
                   how brain networks vary across individuals or
                   neuropsychiatric populations or are altered during
                   the performance of specific behaviors. However, the
                   plausibility and validity of such measurements is
                   dependent on the extent to which functional networks
                   are stable over time or are state dependent. We
                   analyzed data from nine high-quality, highly sampled
                   individuals to parse the magnitude and anatomical
                   distribution of network variability across subjects,
                   sessions, and tasks. Critically, we find that
                   functional networks are dominated by common
                   organizational principles and stable individual
                   features, with substantially more modest
                   contributions from task-state and day-to-day
                   variability. Sources of variation were differentially
                   distributed across the brain and differentially
                   linked to intrinsic and task-evoked sources. We
                   conclude that functional networks are suited to
                   measuring stable individual characteristics,

                   the entire brain. Using four resting-state fMRI
                   datasets with a wide range of ages, we show that
                   individual differences of the functional connectome
                   are stable across 3 months to 1–2 years (and even
                   detectable at above-chance levels across 3 years).
                   Medial frontal and frontoparietal networks appear to
                   be both unique and stable, resulting in high ID
                   rates, as did a combination of these two networks. We

  abstract =      {In the cerebral cortex, the activity levels of
                   neuronal populations are continuously fluctuating.
                   When neuronal activity, as measured using functional
                   MRI (fMRI), is temporally coherent across 2
                   populations, those populations are said to be
                   functionally connected. Functional connectivity has
                   previously been shown to correlate with structural
                   (anatomical) connectivity patterns at an aggregate
                   level. In the present study we investigate, with the
                   aid of computational modeling, whether systems-level
                   properties of functional networks–including their
                   spatial statistics and their persistence across
                   time–can be accounted for by properties of the
                   underlying anatomical network. We measured resting
                   state functional connectivity (using fMRI) and
                   structural connectivity (using diffusion spectrum
                   imaging tractography) in the same individuals at high
                   resolution. Structural connectivity then provided the
                   couplings for a model of macroscopic cortical
                   dynamics. In both model and data, we observed (i)
                   that strong functional connections commonly exist
                   between regions with no direct structural connection,
                   rendering the inference of structural connectivity
                   from functional connectivity impractical; (ii) that
                   indirect connections and interregional distance
                   accounted for some of the variance in functional
                   connectivity that was unexplained by direct
                   structural connectivity; and (iii) that resting-state
                   functional connectivity exhibits variability within
                   and across both scanning sessions and model runs.
                   These empirical and modeling results demonstrate that
                   although resting state functional connectivity is
                   variable and is frequently present between regions
                   without direct structural linkage, its strength,
                   persistence, and spatial statistics are nevertheless
                   constrained by the large-scale anatomical structure
                   of the human cerebral cortex.},

                   Interregional projections promote synchrony among
                   distant neuronal populations, giving rise to richly
                   patterned functional networks. A variety of
                   statistical, communication, and biophysical models
                   have been proposed to study the relationship between
                   brain structure and function, but the link is not yet
                   known. In the present report we seek to relate the
                   structural and functional connection profiles of
                   individual brain areas. We apply a simple multilinear
                   model that incorporates information about spatial
                   proximity, routing, and diffusion between brain
                   regions to predict their functional connectivity. We
                   find that structure–function relationships vary
                   markedly across the neocortex. Structure and function
                   correspond closely in unimodal, primary sensory, and
                   motor regions, but diverge in transmodal cortex,
                   particularly the default mode and salience networks.
                   The divergence between structure and function
                   systematically follows functional and
                   cytoarchitectonic hierarchies. Altogether, the
                   present results demonstrate that structural and
                   functional networks do not align uniformly across the
                   brain, but gradually uncouple in higher-order
                   polysensory areas.},

                   predicated on identifying reliable individual-level
                   diagnostic biomarkers. For psychosis, measures of
                   structural and functional connectivity could be
                   promising biomarkers given consistent reports of
                   dysconnectivity across psychotic disorders using
                   magnetic resonance imaging. Methods We leveraged data
                   from four independent cohorts of patients with
                   psychosis and control subjects with observations from
                   approximately 800 individuals. We used group-level
                   analyses and two supervised machine learning
                   algorithms (support vector machines and ridge
                   regression) to test within-, between-, and
                   across-sample classification performance of white
                   matter and resting-state connectivity metrics.
                   Results Although we replicated group-level
                   differences in brain connectivity, individual-level
                   classification was suboptimal. Classification
                   performance within samples was variable across folds
                   (highest area under the curve [AUC] range = 0.30)
                   and across datasets (average support vector machine
                   AUC range = 0.50; average ridge regression AUC
                   range = 0.18). Classification performance between
                   samples was similarly variable or resulted in AUC
                   values of approximately 0.65, indicating a lack of
                   model generalizability. Furthermore, collapsing
                   across samples (resting-state functional magnetic
                   resonance imaging, N = 888; diffusion tensor
                   imaging, N = 860) did not improve model performance
                   (maximal AUC = 0.67). Ridge regression models
                   generally outperformed support vector machine models,
                   although classification performance was still
                   suboptimal in terms of clinical relevance. Adjusting
                   for demographic covariates did not greatly affect
                   results. Conclusions Connectivity measures were not
                   suitable as diagnostic biomarkers for psychosis as
                   assessed in this study. Our results do not negate
                   that other approaches may be more successful,
                   although it is clear that a systematic approach to
                   individual-level classification with large
                   independent validation samples is necessary to
                   properly vet neuroimaging features as diagnostic

                   fiber reconstruction methods, particularly at the
                   macro-scale afforded by magnetic resonance imaging.
                   Tensor-guided deterministic tractography yields
                   sparse connectomes that are incomplete and contain
                   false negatives (FNs), whereas probabilistic methods
                   steered by crossing-fiber models yield dense
                   connectomes, often with low specificity due to false
                   positives (FPs). Densely reconstructed probabilistic
                   connectomes are typically thresholded to improve
                   specificity at the cost of a reduction in
                   sensitivity. What is the optimal tradeoff between
                   connectome sensitivity and specificity? We show
                   empirically and theoretically that specificity is
                   paramount. Our evaluations of the impact of FPs and
                   FNs on empirical connectomes indicate that
                   specificity is at least twice as important as
                   sensitivity when estimating key properties of brain
                   networks, including topological measures of network
                   clustering, network efficiency and network
                   modularity. Our asymptotic analysis of small-world
                   networks with idealized modular structure reveals
                   that as the number of nodes grows, specificity
                   becomes exactly twice as important as sensitivity to
                   the estimation of the clustering coefficient. For the
                   estimation of network efficiency, the relative
                   importance of specificity grows linearly with the
                   number of nodes. The greater importance of
                   specificity is due to FPs occurring more prevalently
                   between network modules rather than within them.
                   These spurious inter-modular connections have a
                   dramatic impact on network topology. We argue that
                   efforts to maximize the sensitivity of connectome
                   reconstruction should be realigned with the need to
                   map brain networks with high specificity.},

                   changes cause systematic but spurious correlation
                   structures throughout the brain. Specifically, many
                   long-distance correlations are decreased by subject
                   motion, whereas many short-distance correlations are
                   increased. These changes in rs-fcMRI correlations do

                   large fluctuations in fMRI time series, which
                   manifest as structured spatial patterns of temporal
                   correlations between distant brain regions. Here, we
                   investigated whether such “physiological
                   networks”—sets of segregated brain regions that
                   exhibit similar responses following slow changes in
                   systemic physiology—resemble patterns associated
                   with large-scale networks typically attributed to
                   remotely synchronized neuronal activity. By analyzing
                   a large group of subjects from the 3T Human
                   Connectome Project (HCP) database, we demonstrate
                   brain-wide and noticeably heterogenous dynamics
                   tightly coupled to either respiratory variation or
                   heart rate changes. We show, using synthesized data
                   generated from physiological recordings across
                   subjects, that these physiologically-coupled
                   fluctuations alone can produce networks that strongly
                   resemble previously reported resting-state networks,
                   suggesting that, in some cases, the “physiological
                   networks” seem to mimic the neuronal networks.
                   Further, we show that such physiologically-relevant
                   connectivity estimates appear to dominate the overall
                   connectivity observations in multiple HCP subjects,
                   and that this apparent “physiological
                   connectivity” cannot be removed by the use of a
                   single nuisance regressor for the entire brain (such
                   as global signal regression) due to the clear
                   regional heterogeneity of the physiologically-coupled
                   responses. Our results challenge previous notions
                   that physiological confounds are either localized to
                   large veins or globally coherent across the cortex,
                   therefore emphasizing the necessity to consider
                   potential physiological contributions in fMRI-based
                   functional connectivity studies. The rich
                   spatiotemporal patterns carried by such
                   “physiological” dynamics also suggest great
                   potential for clinical biomarkers that are
                   complementary to large-scale neuronal networks.},

                   methods suffer from the absence of structural

                   functional and diffusion MRI, in a multilayer-graph
                   framework that captures transient networks of

                   anatomically wired and temporary synchronized brain

                   activation across anatomically connected regions.
                   Within the transient networks, activity propagates
                   through polysynaptic paths that include selective
                   ensembles of structural connections and differ from
                   the structural shortest paths. In the light of the
                   communication-through-coherence principle, the
                   identified spatio-temporal networks could encode
                   communication channels' selection and neural
                   assemblies, which deserves further attention. This
                   work contributes to the understanding of brain
                   structure-function relationships by considering the
                   time-varying nature of resting-state interactions on
                   the axonal scaffold, and it offers a convenient
                   framework to study large-scale communication
                   mechanisms and functional dynamics.},

                   MRI (dMRI) and tractography have been demonstrated in
                   healthy volunteers and more recently in various
                   disorders affecting brain connectivity. However, few
                   studies have addressed the reproducibility of the
                   resulting networks. We measured the test–retest
                   properties of such networks by varying several
                   factors affecting network construction using ten
                   healthy volunteers who underwent a dMRI protocol at
                   1.5 T on two separate occasions. Each T1-weighted
                   brain was parcellated into 84 regions-of-interest and
                   network connections were identified using dMRI and
                   two alternative tractography algorithms, two
                   alternative seeding strategies, a white matter
                   waypoint constraint and three alternative network
                   weightings. In each case, four common graph-theoretic
                   measures were obtained. Network properties were
                   assessed both node-wise and per network in terms of
                   the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and by
                   comparing within- and between-subject differences.
                   Our findings suggest that test–retest performance
                   was improved when: 1) seeding from white matter,
                   rather than grey; and 2) using probabilistic
                   tractography with a two-fibre model and sufficient
                   streamlines, rather than deterministic tensor
                   tractography. In terms of network weighting, a
                   measure of streamline density produced better
                   test–retest performance than tract-averaged
                   diffusion anisotropy, although it remains unclear
                   which is a more accurate representation of the
                   underlying connectivity. For the best performing
                   configuration, the global within-subject differences
                   were between 3.2\% and 11.9\% with ICCs between 0.62
                   and 0.76. The mean nodal within-subject differences
                   were between 5.2\% and 24.2\% with mean ICCs between
                   0.46 and 0.62. For 83.3\% (70/84) of nodes, the
                   within-subject differences were smaller than
                   between-subject differences. Overall, these findings
                   suggest that whilst current techniques produce
                   networks capable of characterising the genuine
                   between-subject differences in connectivity, future
                   work must be undertaken to improve network
                   reliability.},

  abstract =      {Diffusion MRI tractography is the most widely used
                   macroscale method for mapping connectomes in vivo.
                   However, tractography is prone to various errors and
                   biases, and thus tractography-derived connectomes
                   require careful validation. Here, we critically
                   review studies that have developed or utilized
                   phantoms and tracer maps to validate
                   tractography-derived connectomes, either
                   quantitatively or qualitatively. We identify key
                   factors impacting connectome reconstruction accuracy,
                   including streamline seeding, propagation and
                   filtering methods, and consider the strengths and
                   limitations of state-of-the-art connectome phantoms
                   and associated validation studies. These studies
                   demonstrate the inherent limitations of current fiber
                   orientation models and tractography algorithms and
                   their impact on connectome reconstruction accuracy.
                   Reconstructing connectomes with both high sensitivity
                   and high specificity is challenging, given that some
                   tractography methods can generate an abundance of
                   spurious connections, while others can overlook
                   genuine fiber bundles. We argue that streamline
                   filtering can minimize spurious connections and
                   potentially improve the biological plausibility of
                   connectomes derived from tractography. We find that
                   algorithmic choices such as the tractography seeding
                   methodology, angular threshold, and streamline
                   propagation method can substantially impact
                   connectome reconstruction accuracy. Hence, careful
                   application of tractography is necessary to
                   reconstruct accurate connectomes. Improvements in
                   diffusion MRI acquisition techniques will not
                   necessarily overcome current tractography limitations
                   without accompanying modeling and algorithmic
                   advances.},

                   microstructural, and connectivity-based differences
                   between subjects, but variability due to session and
                   scanner biases is a challenge. Methods To investigate
                   DWI variability, we present MASiVar, a multisite data
                   set consisting of 319 diffusion scans acquired at 3 T
                   from b = 1000 to 3000 s/mm2 across 14 healthy adults,
                   83 healthy children (5 to 8 years), three sites, and
                   four scanners as a publicly available, preprocessed,
                   and de-identified data set. With the adult data, we
                   demonstrate the capacity of MASiVar to simultaneously
                   quantify the intrasession, intersession,
                   interscanner, and intersubject variability of four
                   common DWI processing approaches: (1) a tensor signal
                   representation, (2) a multi-compartment neurite
                   orientation dispersion and density model, (3)
                   white-matter bundle segmentation, and (4) structural
                   connectomics. Respectively, we evaluate region-wise
                   fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and
                   principal eigenvector; region-wise CSF volume
                   fraction, intracellular volume fraction, and
                   orientation dispersion index; bundle-wise shape,
                   volume, fractional anisotropy, and length; and whole
                   connectome correlation and maximized modularity,
                   global efficiency, and characteristic path length.
                   Results We plot the variability in these measures at
                   each level and find that it consistently increases
                   with intrasession to intersession to interscanner to
                   intersubject effects across all processing approaches
                   and that sometimes interscanner variability can
                   approach intersubject variability. Conclusions This
                   study demonstrates the potential of MASiVar to more
                   globally investigate DWI variability across multiple
                   levels and processing approaches simultaneously and
                   suggests harmonization between scanners for multisite
                   analyses should be considered before inference of
                   group differences on subjects.},

                   acquisition and processing of resting-state magnetic
                   resonance imaging data used to estimate brain
                   functional organization—or “functional
                   connectivity.” Standards have been proposed based
                   on test–retest reliability, but open questions
                   remain. These include how amount of data per subject
                   influences whole-brain reliability, the influence of
                   increasing runs versus sessions, the spatial
                   distribution of reliability, the reliability of
                   multivariate methods, and, crucially, how reliability
                   maps onto prediction of behavior. We collected a
                   dataset of 12 extensively sampled individuals (144
                   min data each across 2 identically configured
                   scanners) to assess test–retest reliability of
                   whole-brain connectivity within the generalizability
                   theory framework. We used Human Connectome Project
                   data to replicate these analyses and relate
                   reliability to behavioral prediction. Overall, the
                   historical 5-min scan produced poor reliability
                   averaged across connections. Increasing the number of
                   sessions was more beneficial than increasing runs.
                   Reliability was lowest for subcortical connections
                   and highest for within-network cortical connections.
                   Multivariate reliability was greater than univariate.
                   Finally, reliability could not be used to improve
                   prediction; these findings are among the first to
                   underscore this distinction for functional
                   connectivity. A comprehensive understanding of
                   test–retest reliability, including its limitations,

  abstract =      {Background Once considered mere noise, fMRI-based
                   functional connectivity has become a major
                   neuroscience tool in part due to early studies
                   demonstrating its reliability. These fundamental
                   studies revealed only the tip of the iceberg; over
                   the past decade, many test-retest reliability studies
                   have continued to add nuance to our understanding of
                   this complex topic. A summary of these diverse and at
                   times contradictory perspectives is needed.
                   Objectives We aimed to summarize the existing
                   knowledge regarding test-retest reliability of
                   functional connectivity at the most basic unit of
                   analysis: the individual edge level. This entailed
                   (1) a meta-analytic estimate of reliability and (2) a
                   review of factors influencing reliability. Methods A
                   search of Scopus was conducted to identify studies
                   that estimated edge-level test-retest reliability. To
                   facilitate comparisons across studies, eligibility
                   was restricted to studies measuring reliability via
                   the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The
                   meta-analysis included a random effects pooled
                   estimate of mean edge-level ICC, with studies nested
                   within datasets. The review included a narrative
                   summary of factors influencing edge-level ICC.
                   Results From an initial pool of 212 studies, 44
                   studies were identified for the qualitative review
                   and 25 studies for quantitative meta-analysis. On
                   average, individual edges exhibited a “poor” ICC
                   of 0.29 (95\% CI = 0.23 to 0.36). The most
                   reliable measurements tended to involve: (1)
                   stronger, within-network, cortical edges, (2) eyes
                   open, awake, and active recordings, (3) more
                   within-subject data, (4) shorter test-retest
                   intervals, (5) no artifact correction (likely due in
                   part to reliable artifact), and (6) full
                   correlation-based connectivity with shrinkage.
                   Conclusion This study represents the first
                   meta-analysis and systematic review investigating
                   test-retest reliability of edge-level functional
                   connectivity. Key findings suggest there is room for
                   improvement, but care should be taken to avoid
                   promoting reliability at the expense of validity. By
                   pooling existing knowledge regarding this key facet
                   of accuracy, this study supports broader efforts to
                   improve inferences in the field.},

  abstract =      {Pioneering work in human neuroscience has relied on
                   the ability to map brain function using task-based
                   fMRI, but the empirical validity of these inferential
                   methods is still being characterized. A recent
                   landmark study by Eklund and colleagues showed that
                   popular multiple comparison corrections based on
                   cluster extent suffer from unexpectedly low
                   specificity (i.e., high false positive rate). Yet
                   that study’s focus on specificity, while important,
                   is incomplete. The validity of a method depends also
                   on its sensitivity (i.e., true positive rate or
                   power), yet the sensitivity of cluster correction
                   remains poorly understood. Here, we assessed the
                   sensitivity of gold-standard nonparametric cluster
                   correction by resampling real data from five tasks in
                   the Human Connectome Project and comparing results
                   with those from the full “ground truth” datasets
                   (n ​= ​480–493). Critically, we found that
                   sensitivity after correction is lower than may be
                   practical for many fMRI applications. In particular,
                   sensitivity to medium-sized effects
                   ({\textbar}Cohen’s d{\textbar} ​= ​0.5) was
                   less than 20\% across tasks on average, about three
                   times smaller than without any correction.
                   Furthermore, cluster extent correction exhibited a
                   spatial bias in sensitivity that was independent of
                   effect size. In comparison, correction based on the
                   Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE) statistic
                   approximately doubled sensitivity across tasks but
                   increased spatial bias. These results suggest that we
                   have, until now, only measured the tip of the iceberg
                   in the activation-mapping literature due to our goal
                   of limiting the familywise error rate through cluster
                   extent-based inference. There is a need to revise our
                   practices to improve sensitivity; we therefore
                   conclude with a list of modern strategies to boost
                   sensitivity while maintaining respectable specificity
                   in future investigations.},

                   variables within the Adolescent Brain Cognitive
                   Development Study. A sample of participants with an
                   adequate sample of quality baseline rs-fMRI data
                   containing low average motion (framewise
                   displacement ≤ 0.15; low-noise; n = 4,356) was
                   compared to a sample of participants without an
                   adequate sample of quality data and/or containing
                   high average motion (higher-noise; n = 7,437) using
                   Chi-squared analyses and t-tests. A linear mixed

                   sociodemographic characteristics and average head
                   motion in the sample with low-noise data. Relative to
                   the sample with higher-noise data, the low-noise
                   sample included more females, youth identified by
                   parents as non-Hispanic white, and youth with married
                   parents, higher parent education, and greater
                   household incomes (ORs = 1.32–1.42). Youth in the
                   low-noise sample were also older and had higher
                   neurocognitive skills, lower BMIs, and fewer
                   externalizing and neurodevelopmental problems (ds =
                   0.12–0.30). Within the low-noise sample, several
                   clinical and demographic characteristics related to
                   motion. Thus, participants with low-noise rs-fMRI
                   data may be less representative of the general
                   population and motion may remain a confound in this
                   sample. Future rs-fMRI studies of youth should
                   consider these limitations in the design and analysis
                   stages in order to optimize the representativeness

  abstract =      {In designing cognitive neuroscience experiments,
                   resource limitations induce a fundamental trade-off
                   between sampling variation across individual brains
                   and sampling variation across experimental
                   conditions. Here, we argue that extensive sampling of
                   experimental conditions is essential for
                   understanding how human brains process complex
                   stimuli, that a model of how any one brain does this
                   is likely to generalize to most other brains, and
                   that introducing large numbers of subjects into an
                   analysis pool is likely to introduce unnecessary and
                   undesirable variance. Thus, contrary to conventional
                   wisdom, we believe that sampling many individuals
                   provides relatively few benefits and that extensive
                   sampling of a limited number of subjects is more
                   productive for revealing general principles.
                   Furthermore, an emphasis on depth in individual
                   brains is well-suited for capitalizing on the
                   improvements in resolution and signal-to-noise ratio

                   can be detected in milder cases, and whether this can
                   reveal possible mechanisms contributing to brain
                   pathology. Here, we investigated brain changes in 785
                   UK Biobank participants (aged 51–81) imaged twice,
                   including 401 cases who tested positive for infection
                   with SARS-CoV-2 between their two scans, with 141
                   days on average separating their diagnosis and second
                   scan, and 384 controls. The availability of
                   pre-infection imaging data reduces the likelihood of
                   pre-existing risk factors being misinterpreted as
                   disease effects. We identified significant
                   longitudinal effects when comparing the two groups,
                   including: (i) greater reduction in grey matter
                   thickness and tissue-contrast in the orbitofrontal
                   cortex and parahippocampal gyrus, (ii) greater
                   changes in markers of tissue damage in regions
                   functionally-connected to the primary olfactory
                   cortex, and (iii) greater reduction in global brain
                   size. The infected participants also showed on
                   average larger cognitive decline between the two
                   timepoints. Importantly, these imaging and cognitive
                   longitudinal effects were still seen after excluding
                   the 15 cases who had been hospitalised. These mainly
                   limbic brain imaging results may be the in vivo
                   hallmarks of a degenerative spread of the disease via
                   olfactory pathways, of neuroinflammatory events, or
                   of the loss of sensory input due to anosmia. Whether
                   this deleterious impact can be partially reversed, or

                   variation in hormone concentrations over menstrual

  abstract =      {Many studies have shown that the human endocrine
                   system modulates brain function, reporting
                   associations between fluctuations in hormone
                   concentrations and both brain activity and
                   connectivity. However, how hormonal fluctuations
                   impact fast changes in brain network structure over
                   short timescales remains unknown. Here, we leverage
                   “edge time series” analysis to investigate the
                   relationship between high-amplitude network states
                   and quotidian variation in sex steroid and
                   gonadotropic hormones in a single individual sampled
                   over the course of two endocrine states, across a
                   natural menstrual cycle and under a hormonal regimen.
                   We find that the frequency of high-amplitude network
                   states are associated with follicle-stimulating and
                   luteinizing hormone, but not the sex hormones
                   estradiol and progesterone. Nevertheless, we show
                   that scan-to-scan variation in the co-fluctuation
                   patterns expressed during network states are robustly
                   linked with the concentration of all four hormones,
                   positing a network-level target of hormonal control.
                   We conclude by speculating on the role of hormones in
                   shaping ongoing brain dynamics.},

  abstract =      {Empirical observations of how labs conduct research
                   indicate that the adoption rate of open practices for
                   transparent, reproducible, and collaborative science
                   remains in its infancy. This is at odds with the
                   overwhelming evidence for the necessity of these
                   practices and their benefits for individual
                   researchers, scientific progress, and society in
                   general. To date, information required for
                   implementing open science practices throughout the
                   different steps of a research project is scattered
                   among many different sources. Even experienced
                   researchers in the topic find it hard to navigate the
                   ecosystem of tools and to make sustainable choices.
                   Here, we provide an integrated overview of
                   community-developed resources that can support
                   collaborative, open, reproducible, replicable, robust
                   and generalizable neuroimaging throughout the entire
                   research cycle from inception to publication and
                   across different neuroimaging modalities. We review
                   tools and practices supporting study inception and
                   planning, data acquisition, research data management,
                   data processing and analysis, and research
                   dissemination. We believe it will prove helpful for
                   researchers and institutions to make a successful and
                   sustainable move towards open and reproducible
                   science and to eventually take an active role in its

                   have become increasingly complex and flexible. Here
                   we assess the effect of this flexibility on the
                   results of functional magnetic resonance imaging by
                   asking 70 independent teams to analyse the same
                   dataset, testing the same 9 ex-ante hypotheses1. The
                   flexibility of analytical approaches is exemplified
                   by the fact that no two teams chose identical
                   workflows to analyse the data. This flexibility
                   resulted in sizeable variation in the results of
                   hypothesis tests, even for teams whose statistical
                   maps were highly correlated at intermediate stages of
                   the analysis pipeline. Variation in reported results
                   was related to several aspects of analysis
                   methodology. Notably, a meta-analytical approach that
                   aggregated information across teams yielded a
                   significant consensus in activated regions.
                   Furthermore, prediction markets of researchers in the
                   field revealed an overestimation of the likelihood of
                   significant findings, even by researchers with direct
                   knowledge of the dataset2–5. Our findings show that
                   analytical flexibility can have substantial effects
                   on scientific conclusions, and identify factors that
                   may be related to variability in the analysis of

                   networks. Using concurrent neuronal and vascular
                   stimuli, we collected 30 BOLD fMRI datasets in 10
                   healthy individuals: a working memory task, flashing
                   checkerboard stimulus, and CO2 inhalation challenge
                   were delivered in concurrent but orthogonal
                   paradigms. The resulting imaging data were averaged
                   together and decomposed using independent component
                   analysis, and three “neuronal networks” were
                   identified as demonstrating maximum temporal
                   correlation with the neuronal stimulus paradigms:
                   Default Mode Network, Task Positive Network, and
                   Visual Network. For each of these, we observed a
                   second network component with high spatial overlap.
                   Using dual regression in the original 30 datasets, we
                   extracted the time-series associated with these
                   network pairs and calculated the percent of variance
                   explained by the neuronal or vascular stimuli using a
                   normalized R2 parameter. In each pairing, one network
                   was dominated by the appropriate neuronal stimulus,
                   and the other was dominated by the vascular stimulus
                   as represented by the end-tidal CO2 time-series
                   recorded in each scan. We acquired a second dataset
                   in 8 of the original participants, where no CO2
                   challenge was delivered and CO2 levels fluctuated
                   naturally with breathing variations. Although
                   splitting of functional networks was not robust in
                   these data, performing dual regression with the
                   network maps from the original analysis in this new
                   dataset successfully replicated our observations.
                   Thus, in addition to responding to localized
                   metabolic changes, the brain’s vasculature may be
                   regulated in a coordinated manner that mimics (and
                   potentially supports) specific functional brain
                   networks. Multi-modal imaging and advances in fMRI
                   acquisition and analysis could facilitate further
                   study of the dual nature of functional brain
                   networks. It will be critical to understand
                   network-specific vascular function, and the behavior
                   of a coupled vascular-neural network, in future
                   studies of brain pathology.},

                   connectivity observed during task performance and
                   rest show promise for predicting individual
                   differences in sustained attention as well as other
                   forms of attention. The sensitivity of
                   connectome-based models to attentional state changes,

                   and between individuals, with encouraging progress
                   toward understanding the consequences of this
                   variability for cognition and behavior. At the same
                   time, well-founded concerns over rigor and
                   reproducibility in psychology and neuroscience have
                   led many to question whether functional connectivity
                   is sufficiently reliable, and call for methods to
                   improve its reliability. The thesis of this opinion
                   piece is that when studying variability in functional
                   connectivity—both across individuals and within
                   individuals over time—we should use behavior
                   prediction as our benchmark rather than optimize
                   reliability for its own sake. We discuss theoretical
                   and empirical evidence to compel this perspective,
                   both when the goal is to study stable, trait-level
                   differences between people, as well as when the goal
                   is to study state-related changes within individuals.
                   We hope that this piece will be useful to the
                   neuroimaging community as we continue efforts to
                   characterize inter- and intra-subject variability in

                   of the brain’s functional networks without
                   requiring participants to perform tasks. Robust
                   changes in such resting state networks (RSNs) have
                   been observed in neurologic disorders, and rs-fMRI
                   outcome measures are candidate biomarkers for
                   monitoring clinical trials, including trials of
                   extended therapeutic interventions for rehabilitation
                   of patients with chronic conditions. In this study,
                   we aim to present a unique longitudinal dataset
                   reporting on a healthy adult subject scanned weekly
                   over 3.5 years and identify rs-fMRI outcome measures
                   appropriate for clinical trials. Accordingly, we
                   assessed the reproducibility, and characterized the
                   temporal structure of, rs-fMRI outcome measures
                   derived using independent component analysis (ICA).
                   Data was compared to a 21-person dataset acquired on
                   the same scanner in order to confirm that the values
                   of the single-subject RSN measures were within the
                   expected range as assessed from the multi-participant
                   dataset. Fourteen RSNs were identified, and the
                   inter-session reproducibility of outcome
                   measures—network spatial map, temporal signal
                   fluctuation magnitude, and between-network
                   connectivity (BNC)–was high, with executive RSNs
                   showing the highest reproducibility. Analysis of the
                   weekly outcome measures also showed that many rs-fMRI
                   outcome measures had a significant linear trend,
                   annual periodicity, and persistence. Such temporal
                   structure was most prominent in spatial map
                   similarity, and least prominent in BNC. High
                   reproducibility supports the candidacy of rs-fMRI
                   outcome measures as biomarkers, but the presence of
                   significant temporal structure needs to be taken into
                   account when such outcome measures are considered as
                   biomarkers for rehabilitation-style therapeutic
                   interventions in chronic conditions.},

  abstract =      {Purpose In this work, we present the MASSIVE
                   (Multiple Acquisitions for Standardization of
                   Structural Imaging Validation and Evaluation) brain
                   dataset of a single healthy subject, which is
                   intended to facilitate diffusion MRI (dMRI) modeling
                   and methodology development. Methods MRI data of one
                   healthy subject (female, 25 years) were acquired on a
                   clinical 3 Tesla system (Philips Achieva) with an
                   eight-channel head coil. In total, the subject was
                   scanned on 18 different occasions with a total
                   acquisition time of 22.5 h. The dMRI data were
                   acquired with an isotropic resolution of 2.5 mm3
                   and distributed over five shells with b-values up to
                   4000 s/mm2 and two Cartesian grids with b-values up
                   to 9000 s/mm2. Results The final dataset consists of
                   8000 dMRI volumes, corresponding B0 field maps and
                   noise maps for subsets of the dMRI scans, and ten
                   three-dimensional FLAIR, T1-, and T2-weighted scans.
                   The average signal-to-noise-ratio of the
                   non–diffusion-weighted images was roughly 35.
                   Conclusion This unique set of in vivo MRI data will
                   provide a robust framework to evaluate novel
                   diffusion processing techniques and to reliably
                   compare different approaches for diffusion modeling.

                   responses to tens of thousands of richly annotated
                   natural scenes were measured while participants

                   data quality, we developed and applied novel
                   estimation and denoising techniques. Simple visual
                   inspections of the NSD data reveal clear

                   subsequent image processing and analysis. Visual
                   inspection is subjective and impractical for large
                   scale datasets. Although automated quality
                   assessments have been demonstrated on single-site
                   datasets, it is unclear that solutions can generalize
                   to unseen data acquired at new sites. Here, we
                   introduce the MRI Quality Control tool (MRIQC), a
                   tool for extracting quality measures and fitting a
                   binary (accept/exclude) classifier. Our tool can be
                   run both locally and as a free online service via the
                   OpenNeuro.org portal. The classifier is trained on a
                   publicly available, multi-site dataset (17 sites, N =
                   1102). We perform model selection evaluating
                   different normalization and feature exclusion
                   approaches aimed at maximizing across-site
                   generalization and estimate an accuracy of 76\%±13\%
                   on new sites, using leave-one-site-out
                   cross-validation. We confirm that result on a
                   held-out dataset (2 sites, N = 265) also obtaining a
                   76\% accuracy. Even though the performance of the
                   trained classifier is statistically above chance, we
                   show that it is susceptible to site effects and
                   unable to account for artifacts specific to new
                   sites. MRIQC performs with high accuracy in
                   intra-site prediction, but performance on unseen
                   sites leaves space for improvement which might
                   require more labeled data and new approaches to the
                   between-site variability. Overcoming these
                   limitations is crucial for a more objective quality
                   assessment of neuroimaging data, and to enable the
                   analysis of extremely large and multi-site samples.},

                   Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) response to
                   a CO2 pressure change, is a useful metric of
                   cerebrovascular function. Both the amplitude and the
                   timing (hemodynamic lag) of the CVR response can
                   bring insight into the nature of a cerebrovascular
                   pathology and aid in understanding noise confounds
                   when using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
                   (fMRI) to study neural activity. This research
                   assessed a practical modification to a typical
                   resting-state fMRI protocol, to improve the
                   characterization of cerebrovascular function. In 9
                   healthy subjects, we modelled CVR and lag in three
                   resting-state data segments, and in data segments
                   which added a 2–3 minute breathing task to the
                   start of a resting-state segment. Two different
                   breathing tasks were used to induce fluctuations in
                   arterial CO2 pressure: a breath-hold task to induce
                   hypercapnia (CO2 increase) and a cued deep breathing
                   task to induce hypocapnia (CO2 decrease). Our
                   analysis produced voxel-wise estimates of the
                   amplitude (CVR) and timing (lag) of the BOLD-fMRI
                   response to CO2 by systematically shifting the CO2
                   regressor in time to optimize the model fit. This
                   optimization inherently increases gray matter CVR
                   values and fit statistics. The inclusion of a simple
                   breathing task, compared to a resting-state scan
                   only, increases the number of voxels in the brain
                   that have a significant relationship between CO2 and
                   BOLD-fMRI signals, and improves our confidence in the
                   plausibility of voxel-wise CVR and hemodynamic lag
                   estimates. We demonstrate the clinical utility and
                   feasibility of this protocol in an incidental finding
                   of Moyamoya disease, and explore the possibilities
                   and challenges of using this protocol in younger
                   populations. This hybrid protocol has direct
                   applications for CVR mapping in both research and

  abstract =      {Purpose: In diffusion MRI, a technique known as
                   diffusion spectrum imaging reconstructs the
                   propagator with a discrete Fourier transform, from a
                   Cartesian sampling of the diffusion signal.
                   Alternatively, it is possible to directly reconstruct
                   the orientation distribution function in q-ball
                   imaging, providing so-called high angular resolution
                   diffusion imaging. In between these two techniques,
                   acquisitions on several spheres in q-space offer an
                   interesting trade-off between the angular resolution
                   and the radial information gathered in diffusion MRI.
                   A careful design is central in the success of
                   multishell acquisition and reconstruction techniques.
                   Methods: The design of acquisition in multishell is
                   still an open and active field of research, however.
                   In this work, we provide a general method to design
                   multishell acquisition with uniform angular coverage.
                   This method is based on a generalization of
                   electrostatic repulsion to multishell. Results: We
                   evaluate the impact of our method using simulations,
                   on the angular resolution in one and two bundles of
                   fiber configurations. Compared to more commonly used
                   radial sampling, we show that our method improves the
                   angular resolution, as well as fiber crossing
                   discrimination. Discussion: We propose a novel method
                   to design sampling schemes with optimal angular
                   coverage and show the positive impact on angular
                   resolution in diffusion MRI. Magn Reson Med

                   differences in brain function to differences in
                   behavior across people. Recent work has established
                   that whole-brain functional connectivity patterns are
                   relatively stable within individuals and unique
                   across individuals, and that features of these
                   patterns predict various traits. However, while
                   functional connectivity is most often measured at
                   rest, certain tasks may enhance individual signals
                   and improve sensitivity to behavior differences.
                   Here, we show that compared to the resting state,
                   functional connectivity measured during naturalistic
                   viewing—i.e., movie watching—yields more accurate
                   predictions of trait-like phenotypes in the domains
                   of both cognition and emotion. Traits could be
                   predicted using less than three minutes of data from
                   single video clips, and clips with highly social
                   content gave the most accurate predictions. Results
                   suggest that naturalistic stimuli amplify individual

                   ability of vessels to alter their caliber in response
                   to vasoactive factors, by means of dilating or
                   constricting, in order to increase or decrease
                   regional cerebral blood flow (CBF). Importantly, CVR
                   may provide a sensitive biomarker for pathologies
                   where vasculature is compromised. Furthermore, the
                   spatiotemporal dynamics of CVR observed in healthy
                   subjects, reflecting regional differences in cerebral
                   vascular tone and response, may also be important in
                   functional MRI studies based on neurovascular
                   coupling mechanisms. Assessment of CVR is usually
                   based on the use of a vasoactive stimulus combined
                   with a CBF measurement technique. Although
                   transcranial Doppler ultrasound has been frequently
                   used to obtain global flow velocity measurements, MRI
                   techniques are being increasingly employed for
                   obtaining CBF maps. For the vasoactive stimulus,
                   vasodilatory hypercapnia is usually induced through
                   the manipulation of respiratory gases, including the
                   inhalation of increased concentrations of carbon
                   dioxide. However, most of these methods require an
                   additional apparatus and complex setups, which not
                   only may not be well-tolerated by some populations
                   but are also not widely available. For these reasons,
                   strategies based on voluntary breathing fluctuations
                   without the need for external gas challenges have
                   been proposed. These include the task-based
                   methodologies of breath holding and paced deep
                   breathing, as well as a new generation of methods
                   based on spontaneous breathing fluctuations during
                   resting-state. Despite the multitude of alternatives
                   to gas challenges, existing literature lacks
                   definitive conclusions regarding the best practices
                   for the vasoactive modulation and associated analysis
                   protocols. In this work, we perform an extensive
                   review of CVR mapping techniques based on MRI and CO2
                   variations without gas challenges, focusing on the
                   methodological aspects of the breathing protocols and
                   corresponding data analysis. Finally, we outline a
                   set of practical guidelines based on generally
                   accepted practices and available data, extending
                   previous reports and encouraging the wider

                   16 s), and accurately models the MRI signal changes
                   resulting from breath-holding as well as cued depth
                   and rate changes.},

                   signals from the FMRI time series. As functional MRI
                   is used for a wide variety of applications beyond the
                   identification of regions involved in a task,
                   different sources of noise in the time series become
                   important. The use of arterial spin labelling
                   sequences, either in isolation or combined with BOLD
                   imaging, means that temporal noise must be dealt with

                   global cerebrovascular stimuli, such as respiratory

                   BOLD fMRI to provide a clinical insight into vascular
                   health that can be used to diagnose cerebrovascular
                   disease. Breath-holds are a readily accessible method
                   for producing the required arterial CO2 increases but
                   their implementation into clinical studies is limited
                   by concerns that patients will demonstrate highly
                   variable performance of breath-hold challenges. This
                   study assesses the repeatability of CVR measurements
                   despite poor task performance, to determine if and
                   how robust results could be achieved with
                   breath-holds in patients. Twelve healthy volunteers
                   were scanned at 3T. Six functional scans were
                   acquired, each consisting of 6 breath-hold challenges
                   (10, 15, or 20s duration) interleaved with periods of
                   paced breathing. These scans simulated the varying
                   breath-hold consistency and ability levels that may
                   occur in patient data. Uniform ramps, time-scaled
                   ramps, and end-tidal CO2 data were used as regressors
                   in a general linear model in order to measure CVR at
                   the grey matter, regional, and voxelwise level. The
                   intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) quantified
                   the repeatability of the CVR measurement for each
                   breath-hold regressor type and scale of interest
                   across the variable task performances. The ramp
                   regressors did not fully account for variability in
                   breath-hold performance and did not achieve
                   acceptable repeatability (ICC{\textless}0.4) in
                   several regions analysed. In contrast, the end-tidal
                   CO2 regressors resulted in “excellent”
                   repeatability (ICC=0.82) in the average grey matter
                   data, and resulted in acceptable repeatability in all
                   smaller regions tested (ICC{\textgreater}0.4).
                   Further analysis of intra-subject CVR variability
                   across the brain (ICCspatial and voxelwise
                   correlation) supported the use of end-tidal CO2 data
                   to extract robust whole-brain CVR maps, despite
                   variability in breath-hold performance. We conclude
                   that the incorporation of end-tidal CO2 monitoring
                   into scanning enables robust, repeatable measurement
                   of CVR that makes breath-hold challenges suitable for
                   routine clinical practice.},

                   level-dependent (BOLD) signal calibration, the
                   breath-hold task offers considerable potential for
                   the quantification of neuronal activity from
                   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
                   measurements. With an aim to improve the precision of
                   this calibration method, the impact of respiratory
                   rate control on the BOLD signal achieved with the
                   breath-hold task was investigated. In addition to
                   self-paced breathing, three different computer-paced
                   breathing rates were imposed during the periods
                   between end-expiration breath-hold blocks. The
                   resulting BOLD signal timecourses and statistical
                   activation maps were compared in eleven healthy human
                   subjects. Results indicate that computer-paced
                   respiration produces a larger peak BOLD signal
                   increase with breath-hold than self-paced breathing,
                   in addition to lower variability between trials. This
                   is due to the more significant post-breath-hold
                   signal undershoot present in self-paced runs, a
                   characteristic which confounds the definition of
                   baseline and is difficult to accurately model.
                   Interestingly, the specific respiratory rate imposed
                   between breath-hold periods generally does not have a
                   statistically significant impact on the BOLD signal
                   change. This result can be explained by previous
                   reports of humans adjusting their inhalation depth to
                   compensate for changes in rate, with the end-goal of
                   maintaining homeostatic ventilation. The advantage of
                   using end-expiration relative to end-inspiration
                   breath-hold is apparent in view of the high
                   repeatability of the BOLD signal in the present
                   study, which does not suffer from the previously
                   reported high variability associated with
                   uncontrolled inspiration depth when using the
                   end-inspiration technique.},

                   Alterations in arterial gas concentrations can lead

                   influenced by the reactivity of the vasculature. By
                   complementing a task-related BOLD acquisition with a
                   vascular reactivity measure obtained through
                   breath-holding or hypercapnia, this unwanted variance
                   can be statistically reduced in the BOLD responses of

                   vascular reactivity can also be estimated using a
                   resting state scan. This study aimed to compare three
                   breath-hold based analysis approaches (block design,
                   sine–cosine regressor and CO2 regressor) and a
                   resting state approach (CO2 regressor) to measure
                   vascular reactivity. We tested BOLD variance
                   explained by the model and repeatability of the
                   measures. Fifteen healthy participants underwent a
                   breath-hold task and a resting state scan with
                   end-tidal CO2 being recorded during both. Vascular
                   reactivity was defined as CO2-related BOLD percent
                   signal change/mmHg change in CO2. Maps and regional
                   vascular reactivity estimates showed high
                   repeatability when the breath-hold task was used.
                   Repeatability and variance explained by the CO2 trace
                   regressor were lower for the resting state data based
                   approach, which resulted in highly variable measures
                   of vascular reactivity. We conclude that breath-hold
                   based vascular reactivity estimations are more
                   repeatable than resting-based estimates, and that
                   there are limitations with replacing breath-hold

                   robust method to estimate cerebrovascular reactivity
                   (CVR). However, movement and breathing-related
                   artefacts caused by the BH can substantially hinder
                   CVR estimates due to their high temporal collinearity
                   with the effect of interest, and attention has to be
                   paid when choosing which analysis model should be
                   applied to the data. In this study, we evaluate the
                   performance of multiple analysis strategies based on
                   lagged general linear models applied on multi-echo
                   BOLD fMRI data, acquired in ten subjects performing a
                   BH task during ten sessions, to obtain
                   subject-specific CVR and haemodynamic lag estimates.
                   The evaluated approaches range from conventional
                   regression models, i.e. including drifts and motion
                   timecourses as nuisance regressors, applied on
                   single-echo or optimally-combined data, to more
                   complex models including regressors obtained from
                   multi-echo independent component analysis with
                   different grades of orthogonalization in order to
                   preserve the effect of interest, i.e. the CVR. We
                   compare these models in terms of their ability to
                   make signal intensity changes independent from
                   motion, as well as the reliability as measured by
                   voxelwise intraclass correlation coefficients of both
                   CVR and lag maps over time. Our results reveal that a
                   conservative independent component analysis model
                   applied on the optimally-combined multi-echo fMRI
                   signal offers the largest reduction of motion-related
                   effects in the signal, while yielding reliable CVR
                   amplitude and lag estimates, although a conventional
                   regression model applied on the optimally-combined
                   data results in similar estimates. This work
                   demonstrates the usefulness of multi-echo based fMRI
                   acquisitions and independent component analysis
                   denoising for precision mapping of CVR in single
                   subjects based on BH paradigms, fostering its
                   potential as a clinically-viable neuroimaging tool
                   for individual patients. It also proves that the way
                   in which data-driven regressors should be

                   techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) often
                   use a target or template volume to facilitate
                   processing, take advantage of prior information, and
                   define a common coordinate system for analysis. In
                   the neuroimaging literature, the MNI305
                   Talairach-like coordinate system is often used as a
                   standard template. However, when studying pediatric
                   populations, variation from the adult brain makes the
                   MNI305 suboptimal for processing brain images of
                   children. Morphological changes occurring during
                   development render the use of age-appropriate
                   templates desirable to reduce potential errors and
                   minimize bias during processing of pediatric data.
                   This paper presents the methods used to create
                   unbiased, age-appropriate MRI atlas templates for
                   pediatric studies that represent the average anatomy
                   for the age range of 4.5–18.5years, while
                   maintaining a high level of anatomical detail and
                   contrast. The creation of anatomical T1-weighted,
                   T2-weighted, and proton density-weighted templates
                   for specific developmentally important age-ranges,
                   used data derived from the largest epidemiological,
                   representative (healthy and normal) sample of the
                   U.S. population, where each subject was carefully
                   screened for medical and psychiatric factors and
                   characterized using established neuropsychological
                   and behavioral assessments. Use of these age-specific
                   templates was evaluated by computing average tissue
                   maps for gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal
                   fluid for each specific age range, and by conducting
                   an exemplar voxel-wise deformation-based morphometry
                   study using 66 young (4.5–6.9years) participants to
                   demonstrate the benefits of using the age-appropriate
                   templates. The public availability of these
                   atlases/templates will facilitate analysis of
                   pediatric MRI data and enable comparison of results
                   between studies in a common standardized space
                   specific to pediatric research.},

                   functional-imaging datasets, shedding new light on
                   the neural basis of inter-individual differences.
                   Analyzing these large data entails new scalability
                   challenges, computational and statistical. For this
                   reason, brain images are typically summarized in a
                   few signals, for instance reducing voxel-level
                   measures with brain atlases or functional modes. A
                   good choice of the corresponding brain networks is
                   important, as most data analyses start from these
                   reduced signals. We contribute finely-resolved
                   atlases of functional modes, comprising from 64 to
                   1024 networks. These dictionaries of functional modes
                   (DiFuMo) are trained on millions of fMRI functional
                   brain volumes of total size 2.4 ​TB, spanned over
                   27 studies and many research groups. We demonstrate
                   the benefits of extracting reduced signals on our
                   fine-grain atlases for many classic functional data
                   analysis pipelines: stimuli decoding from 12,334
                   brain responses, standard GLM analysis of fMRI across
                   sessions and individuals, extraction of resting-state
                   functional-connectomes biomarkers for 2500
                   individuals, data compression and meta-analysis over
                   more than 15,000 statistical maps. In each of these
                   analysis scenarii, we compare the performance of our
                   functional atlases with that of other popular
                   references, and to a simple voxel-level analysis.
                   Results highlight the importance of using
                   high-dimensional “soft” functional atlases, to
                   represent and analyze brain activity while capturing
                   its functional gradients. Analyses on
                   high-dimensional modes achieve similar statistical
                   performance as at the voxel level, but with much
                   reduced computational cost and higher
                   interpretability. In addition to making them
                   available, we provide meaningful names for these
                   modes, based on their anatomical location. It will
                   facilitate reporting of results.},

                   such network information, which is not always
                   available. In this work, we present a whole-brain
                   multi-scale structural connectome atlas. This tool
                   has been derived from a cohort of 66 healthy subjects
                   imaged with optimal technology in the setting of the
                   Human Connectome Project. From these data we created,

                   white-matter lesions or regional alterations, to
                   specific connections and brain circuits. Accordingly,

                   resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used to
                   investigate the neural correlates of cognition. fMRI
                   non-invasively measures brain activity, allowing
                   identification of patterns evoked by tasks performed
                   during scanning. Despite the long history of this
                   technique, the idiosyncrasies of each dataset have
                   led to the use of ad-hoc preprocessing protocols
                   customized for nearly every different study. This
                   approach is time-consuming, error-prone, and
                   unsuitable for combining datasets from many sources.
                   Here we showcase fMRIPrep, a robust preprocessing
                   tool for virtually any human BOLD (blood-oxygen level
                   dependent) fMRI dataset that addresses the
                   reproducibility concerns of the established protocols

                   capable of preprocessing a diversity of datasets

                   growing popularity of fMRIPrep, this protocol

  abstract =      {Tractography is a class of algorithms aiming at in
                   vivo mapping the major neuronal pathways in the white
                   matter from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging
                   (MRI) data. These techniques offer a powerful tool to
                   noninvasively investigate at the macroscopic scale
                   the architecture of the neuronal connections of the
                   brain. However, unfortunately, the reconstructions
                   recovered with existing tractography algorithms are
                   not really quantitative even though diffusion MRI is
                   a quantitative modality by nature. As a matter of
                   fact, several techniques have been proposed in recent
                   years to estimate, at the voxel level, intrinsic
                   microstructural features of the tissue, such as
                   axonal density and diameter, by using
                   multicompartment models. In this paper, we present a
                   novel framework to reestablish the link between
                   tractography and tissue microstructure. Starting from
                   an input set of candidate fiber-tracts, which are
                   estimated from the data using standard fiber-tracking
                   techniques, we model the diffusion MRI signal in each
                   voxel of the image as a linear combination of the
                   restricted and hindered contributions generated in
                   every location of the brain by these candidate
                   tracts. Then, we seek for the global weight of each
                   of them, i.e., the effective contribution or volume,
                   such that they globally fit the measured signal at
                   best. We demonstrate that these weights can be easily
                   recovered by solving a global convex optimization
                   problem and using efficient algorithms. The
                   effectiveness of our approach has been evaluated both
                   on a realistic phantom with known ground-truth and in
                   vivo brain data. Results clearly demonstrate the
                   benefits of the proposed formulation, opening new
                   perspectives for a more quantitative and biologically
                   plausible assessment of the structural connectivity
                   of the brain.},

                   resting state functional connectivity fMRI (RSFC). In
                   this report we examine impact of motion on signal
                   intensity and RSFC correlations. We find that
                   motion-induced signal changes (1) are often complex
                   and variable waveforms, (2) are often shared across
                   nearly all brain voxels, and (3) often persist more
                   than 10s after motion ceases. These signal changes,
                   both during and after motion, increase observed RSFC
                   correlations in a distance-dependent manner.
                   Motion-related signal changes are not removed by a
                   variety of motion-based regressors, but are
                   effectively reduced by global signal regression. We
                   link several measures of data quality to motion,
                   changes in signal intensity, and changes in RSFC
                   correlations. We demonstrate that improvements in
                   data quality measures during processing may represent
                   cosmetic improvements rather than true correction of
                   the data. We demonstrate a within-subject,
                   censoring-based artifact removal strategy based on
                   volume censoring that reduces group differences due
                   to motion to chance levels. We note conditions under
                   which group-level regressions do and do not correct
                   motion-related effects.},

                   hypotheses about regionally specific effects in
                   neuroimaging data. The most established sorts of
                   statistical parametric maps (e.g., Friston et al.
                   [1991]: J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 11:690–699;

                   12:900–918) are based on linear models, for example
                   ANCOVA, correlation coefficients and t tests. In the
                   sense that these examples are all special cases of
                   the general linear model it should be possible to
                   implement them (and many others) within a unified
                   framework. We present here a general approach that
                   accomodates most forms of experimental layout and
                   ensuing analysis (designed experiments with fixed
                   effects for factors, covariates and interaction of
                   factors). This approach brings together two well
                   established bodies of theory (the general linear
                   model and the theory of Gaussian fields) to provide a
                   complete and simple framework for the analysis of
                   imaging data. The importance of this framework is
                   twofold: (i) Conceptual and mathematical simplicity,
                   in that the same small number of operational
                   equations is used irrespective of the complexity of
                   the experiment or nature of the statistical model and
                   (ii) the generality of the framework provides for
                   great latitude in experimental design and analysis.

  abstract =      {The preprocessing pipelines typically used in both
                   task and resting-state functional magnetic resonance
                   imaging (rs-fMRI) analysis are modular in nature:
                   They are composed of a number of separate
                   filtering/regression steps, including removal of head
                   motion covariates and band-pass filtering, performed
                   sequentially and in a flexible order. In this
                   article, we illustrate the shortcomings of this
                   approach, as we show how later preprocessing steps
                   can reintroduce artifacts previously removed from the
                   data in prior preprocessing steps. We show that each
                   regression step is a geometric projection of data
                   onto a subspace, and that performing a sequence of
                   projections can move the data into subspaces no
                   longer orthogonal to those previously removed,
                   reintroducing signal related to nuisance covariates.
                   Thus, linear filtering operations are not
                   commutative, and the order in which the preprocessing
                   steps are performed is critical. These issues can
                   arise in practice when any combination of standard
                   preprocessing steps including motion regression,
                   scrubbing, component-based correction, physiological
                   correction, global signal regression, and temporal
                   filtering are performed sequentially. In this work,
                   we focus primarily on rs-fMRI. We illustrate the
                   problem both theoretically and empirically through
                   application to a test–retest rs-fMRI data set, and
                   suggest remedies. These include (a) combining all
                   steps into a single linear filter, or (b) sequential
                   orthogonalization of covariates/linear filters

  abstract =      {There is great interest in estimating brain
                   “networks” from FMRI data. This is often
                   attempted by identifying a set of functional
                   “nodes” (e.g., spatial ROIs or ICA maps) and then
                   conducting a connectivity analysis between the nodes,
                   based on the FMRI timeseries associated with the
                   nodes. Analysis methods range from very simple
                   measures that consider just two nodes at a time
                   (e.g., correlation between two nodes' timeseries) to
                   sophisticated approaches that consider all nodes
                   simultaneously and estimate one global network model
                   (e.g., Bayes net models). Many different methods are
                   being used in the literature, but almost none has
                   been carefully validated or compared for use on FMRI
                   timeseries data. In this work we generate rich,
                   realistic simulated FMRI data for a wide range of
                   underlying networks, experimental protocols and
                   problematic confounds in the data, in order to
                   compare different connectivity estimation approaches.
                   Our results show that in general correlation-based
                   approaches can be quite successful, methods based on
                   higher-order statistics are less sensitive, and
                   lag-based approaches perform very poorly. More
                   specifically: there are several methods that can give
                   high sensitivity to network connection detection on
                   good quality FMRI data, in particular, partial
                   correlation, regularised inverse covariance
                   estimation and several Bayes net methods; however,
                   accurate estimation of connection directionality is
                   more difficult to achieve, though Patel's τ can be
                   reasonably successful. With respect to the various
                   confounds added to the data, the most striking result
                   was that the use of functionally inaccurate ROIs
                   (when defining the network nodes and extracting their
                   associated timeseries) is extremely damaging to
                   network estimation; hence, results derived from
                   inappropriate ROI definition (such as via structural
                   atlases) should be regarded with great caution.},

  abstract =      {Purpose In echo-planar diffusion-weighted imaging,
                   correcting for susceptibility-induced artifacts
                   typically requires acquiring pairs of images, known
                   as blip-up blip-down acquisitions, to create an
                   undistorted volume as a target to correct distortions
                   that are often focal where regions with differences
                   in magnetic susceptibility interface, such as the
                   frontal and temporal areas. However, blip-up
                   blip-down acquisitions are not always available, and
                   distortion effects may not be specifically localized
                   to such areas, with subtle effects potentially
                   extending throughout the brain. Here, we apply a deep
                   learning technique to generate an undistorted volume
                   to correct susceptibility-induced artifacts and
                   demonstrate implications for image fidelity and
                   diffusion-based inference outside of areas where high
                   focal distortion is present. Methods To demonstrate
                   differences due to susceptibility artifact
                   correction, uncorrected baseline images were compared
                   to identical images where correction was performed
                   using an undistorted target volume produced by the
                   deep learning tool “PreQual”. Widespread
                   geometric distortion was assessed visually by
                   referencing diffusion-weighted images to T1-weighted
                   images. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) were
                   utilized to perform whole brain analysis of
                   fractional anisotropy (FA) values to assess
                   differences between subject groups (depressed vs.
                   non-depressed) via permutation-based, voxel-wise
                   testing. Multivariate regression models were then
                   used to contrast TBSS results between corrected and
                   non-corrected diffusion images. Results
                   Susceptibility artifact correction resulted in
                   visible, widespread improvement in image fidelity
                   when referenced to T1-weighted images. TBSS results
                   were dependent on susceptibility artifact correction
                   with correction resulting in widespread structural
                   alterations of the mean FA skeleton, changes in
                   skeletal FA, and additional positive tests of
                   significance of regression coefficients in subsequent
                   regression models. Conclusion Our results indicated
                   that EPI distortion effects are not purely focal, and
                   that reducing distortion can result in significant
                   differences in the interpretation of diffusion data,
                   even in areas remote from high distortion.},

  abstract =      {We present a new technique called "t-SNE" that
                   visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each
                   datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional
                   map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic
                   Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is
                   much easier to optimize, and produces significantly
                   better visualizations by reducing the tendency to
                   crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE
                   is better than existing techniques at creating a
                   single map that reveals structure at many different
                   scales. This is particularly important for
                   high-dimensional data that lie on several different,
                   but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as
                   images ofobjects from multiple classes seen from
                   multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of
                   very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use
                   random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the
                   implicit structure of all of the data to influence
                   the way in which a subset of the data is displayed.
                   We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide
                   variety of data sets and compare it with many other
                   non-parametric visualization techniques, including
                   Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding.
                   The visualizations produced by t-SNE are
                   significantly better than those produced by the other
                   techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

                   to infer structural changes in brain connectivity
                   resulting from disease progression using cortical
                   thickness measurements from a cohort of participants
                   who were either healthy control, or with mild
                   cognitive impairment, or Alzheimer's disease
                   patients. For this purpose, we develop a novel
                   approach for inference of multiple networks with
                   related edge values across groups. Specifically, we
                   infer a Gaussian graphical model for each group
                   within a joint framework, where we rely on Bayesian
                   hierarchical priors to link the precision matrix
                   entries across groups. Our proposal differs from
                   existing approaches in that it flexibly learns which
                   groups have the most similar edge values, and
                   accounts for the strength of connection (rather than
                   only edge presence or absence) when sharing
                   information across groups. Our results identify key
                   alterations in structural connectivity that may
                   reflect disruptions to the healthy brain, such as
                   decreased connectivity within the occipital lobe with
                   increasing disease severity. We also illustrate the
                   proposed method through simulations, where we
                   demonstrate its performance in structure learning and
                   precision matrix estimation with respect to
                   alternative approaches.},

                   findings, is a prerequisite for scientific discovery
                   and clinical utility. Troublingly, we are in the
                   midst of a replicability crisis. A key to
                   replicability is that multiple measurements of the
                   same item (e.g., experimental sample or clinical
                   participant) under fixed experimental constraints are
                   relatively similar to one another. Thus, statistics
                   that quantify the relative contributions of
                   accidental deviations—such as measurement
                   error—as compared to systematic deviations—such
                   as individual differences—are critical. We
                   demonstrate that existing replicability statistics,
                   such as intra-class correlation coefficient and
                   fingerprinting, fail to adequately differentiate
                   between accidental and systematic deviations in very
                   simple settings. We therefore propose a novel
                   statistic, discriminability, which quantifies the
                   degree to which an individual’s samples are
                   relatively similar to one another, without
                   restricting the data to be univariate, Gaussian, or
                   even Euclidean. Using this statistic, we introduce
                   the possibility of optimizing experimental design via
                   increasing discriminability and prove that optimizing
                   discriminability improves performance bounds in
                   subsequent inference tasks. In extensive simulated
                   and real datasets (focusing on brain imaging and
                   demonstrating on genomics), only optimizing data
                   discriminability improves performance on all
                   subsequent inference tasks for each dataset. We
                   therefore suggest that designing experiments and
                   analyses to optimize discriminability may be a
                   crucial step in solving the replicability crisis, and
                   more generally, mitigating accidental measurement

                   statistical power, enhance generalizability, and to
                   improve the likelihood of pooling relevant subgroups
                   together—activities which are otherwise limited by
                   the availability of subjects or funds at a single
                   site. Even with harmonized imaging sequences,
                   site-dependent variability can mask the advantages of
                   these multi-site studies. The aim of this study was
                   to assess multi-site reproducibility in resting-state
                   functional connectivity “fingerprints”, and to
                   improve identifiability of functional connectomes.
                   The individual fingerprinting of functional
                   connectivity profiles is promising due to its
                   potential as a robust neuroimaging biomarker with
                   which to draw single-subject inferences. We
                   evaluated, on two independent multi-site datasets,
                   individual fingerprints in test-retest visit pairs
                   within and across two sites and present a generalized
                   framework based on principal component analysis to
                   improve identifiability. Those principal components
                   that maximized differential identifiability of a
                   training dataset were used as an orthogonal
                   connectivity basis to reconstruct the individual
                   functional connectomes of training and validation
                   sets. The optimally reconstructed functional
                   connectomes showed a substantial improvement in
                   individual fingerprinting of the subjects within and
                   across the two sites and test-retest visit pairs
                   relative to the original data. A notable increase in
                   ICC values for functional edges and resting-state
                   networks were also observed for reconstructed
                   functional connectomes. Improvements in
                   identifiability were not found to be affected by
                   global signal regression. Post-hoc analyses assessed
                   the effect of the number of fMRI volumes on
                   identifiability and showed that multi-site
                   differential identifiability was for all cases
                   maximized after optimal reconstruction. Finally, the
                   generalizability of the optimal set of orthogonal
                   basis of each dataset was evaluated through a
                   leave-one-out procedure. Overall, results demonstrate
                   that the data-driven framework presented in this
                   study systematically improves identifiability in
                   resting-state functional connectomes in multi-site

  abstract =      {Defacing (i.e. removing facial features) from
                   structural imaging has become a necessary step before
                   data sharing to ensure participants’ anonymity
                   (Schwarz et al. 2021; Fig 1A). This process has
                   proven to have some deleterious effects on the
                   downstream research workflow (de Sitter et al. 2020).
                   Here, we present an exploratory analysis prior to
                   testing the hypothesis that both quality ratings by
                   human experts and the image quality metrics (IQMs)
                   that MRIQC (Esteban et al. 2017) extracts are
                   affected by defacing. We found sufficient evidence on
                   a small sample that there might be an effect.
                   Therefore, we will pre-register and carry out a
                   confirmatory analysis on a larger, unseen, sample.},

                   for the Python programming language. Since its
                   initial release in 2001, SciPy has become a de facto
                   standard for leveraging scientific algorithms in
                   Python, with over 600 unique code contributors,
                   thousands of dependent packages, over 100,000
                   dependent repositories and millions of downloads per
                   year. In this work, we provide an overview of the
                   capabilities and development practices of SciPy 1.0
